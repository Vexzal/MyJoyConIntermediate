this was an attempt to allow use of the nintendo switch joycons as input devices for desktop applications, through monogame.
It didn't work, and I don't even remember if this is the up to date version of this repository. 
While I eventually got input working, there was a problem where there was a huge delay between input on the controller 
and that input being responded to on screen. 
While trying to fix that eventually even normal input stopped working, again mysteriously. 

Most of the c++ code is just copied or created from trying to break down the workings in,

this project.
